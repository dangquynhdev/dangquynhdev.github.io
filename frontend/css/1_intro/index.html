        CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.<br>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

    <h1>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h1>
    <p>
        HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!<br>

        HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:<br>

        &lt;h1>This is a heading</h1><br>

        &lt;p>This is a paragraph.</p><br>

        When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.<br>

        To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
