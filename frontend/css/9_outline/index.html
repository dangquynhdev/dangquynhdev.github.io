    <h1>intro</h1>
    <p>
        Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. <br>
        Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.
    </p>
    <p>
        None of the other outline properties (which you will learn more about in the next chapters) will have ANY effect unless the outline-style property is set!
    </p>
    <h1>offset</h1>
    <p>
        The outline-offset property adds space between an outline and the edge/border of an element. The space between an element and its outline is transparent.
