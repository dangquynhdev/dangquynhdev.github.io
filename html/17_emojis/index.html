        Emojis look like images, or icons, but they are not.<br>
        They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) character set.<br>
        UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.
