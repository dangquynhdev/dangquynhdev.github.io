    <h1>px</h1>
    <p>
        * Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display.
        For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.

    <h1>em</h1>
    <p>Relative to the current font-size of the element </p>
    
    <h1>Absolute Lengths</h1>
    <p>
        Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. 
        However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.
