    <p>
        To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use.
    </p>
    <h1>From ASCII to UTF-8</h1>
    <p>
        ASCII was the first character encoding standard. ASCII defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet
    </p>
    <p>
        The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!
